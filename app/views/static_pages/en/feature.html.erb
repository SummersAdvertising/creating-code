        <h5>The characteristics of 'probability distribution stimulator and statistic analysis software'</h5>
        <b><span>1</span>Probability distribution stimulator</b>
        <p>Current other software do not have this function, Creating Code Company has offered selfishless free 30 continuous probability distribution and 6 discontinuous distribution stimulator be able to stimulate the probability distribution coefficient and probability distribution graphic and the parameter functions contain more than 30 mathematical equations, it is the unparalleled stimulator. The stimulated joint probability distribution and marginal probability distribution can be demonstrated by 3D graphic and 2D graphic.</p>
        <b><span>2</span>Rapidly and tremendous data generator</b>
        <p>Utilize probability distribution stimulator can produces sample data which means take probability distribution as population probability distribution and according this probability distribution stimulate sample data. It takes 2 minutes to produce maximum 30,000,000 sample data by population probability distribution.</p>
        <b><span>3</span>Simple equipment and economical</b>
        <p>Enjoy i-cloud computing and tremendous data analysis by using PC or Notebook contain 4G computer storage and windows 7 or higher windows system.</p>
        <b><span>4</span>Operate easily </b>
        <p>All pull-down menu, people finish the code by input optional functions and numbers and complicated operating is unnecessary.</p>
        <b><span>5</span>Co-exist with other programs</b>
        <p>It can utilize it with other program simultaneously, users can do editing and typesetting directly while output result has completed.</p>
        <b><span>6</span>Use single function and other function links repeatedly</b>
        <p>For example, simple regression analysis has 10 analysis methods, users can process one of them then try other function to compare which analysis method has highly performance. </p>
        <b><span>7</span>Multiple input population distribution method</b>
        <p>It offers related population and independent population input methods and the probability distribution stimulator usage or sample data production are user-friendly. </p>
        <b><span>8</span>Comprehensive output data</b>
        <p>For instance, regression analysis can output each procedure, users can understand each procedure.</p>
        <b><span>9</span>Test statistical sampling distribution to developing test critical value</b>
        <p>All critical value are transformed by probability stimulator with test statistical sampling distribution to test critical value is accurately not limited by distribution and statistical mathematics.</p>
        <b><span>10</span>Free software and offer Mandarin Chinese service</b>
        <p>The software is complimentary, members can have 10 free enquiries per year, and our response via PowerPoint or digital clip. Mandarin Chinese (Traditional) version software is available due to the software was invented and created by Taiwanese.</p>
        <b><span>11</span> This software has reserved fully copyright which means only for individual use without any form of business activities</b>
          <p>Please refer to 'Creating Code Company statistic and operating  booklet price' page if any business activities involved. There will be additional charge after January 1, 2016 when updated software available.</p>
        <b><span>12</span>Statistic analysis function are multiple, convenient, superior difficult, highly technology and accurate</b>
        <p>Utilize output data or probability distribution stimulator to acquire sample data for statistical analysis. 
Creating Code Company can process probability distribution stimulator, the statistical sampling distribution is not a problem neither. 'Probability distribution stimulator and statistical analysis software' establish lots of exclusive test statistic and test standard is more adoptable than current used statistic.
